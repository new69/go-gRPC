# go-gRPC

A Study between comunication with gRPC and go lang

## Steps
I presume that you have go lang installed on your machine.

1. Install all go packages
```bash
go mod tidy
```
2. Start server
```bash
 go run cmd/grpcServer/main.go
```

## Using
For test the calls, I used [Evans](https://github.com/ktr0731/evans), after install you can use it like this:
```bash
evans -r repl
```
